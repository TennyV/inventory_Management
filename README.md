# inventoryManagement

The goal of this project was to design an inventory management application with the ability to store users and inventory items and quantities in an SQLite database. The application needed to also have an optional feature in which you could toggle on and off the ability for the application to send you an SMS if the stock was low.



When I started this project I had a few too many screens, but then quickly realized that too many screens wasn't neccesarily a good thing so I did my best to preserve the best screens to ensure I had enough functionality to do what I needed to do without compromising the integrity of the application.
My designs could have been better by chaning the font of the text within the inventory list.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

When designing the application I focused heaviliy on utilzing the android development documentation and my android development guidebook. With both of these resources I felt that it built me up enough to be able to think outside of the box and venture off to try things I believe would work and challenged myself by accomplishing such a monumental task in a few weeks.
I tested this code by debugging the application with breakpoints and using the stack trace to identify my faults.
This process was important because I can capture every single process that was happening within my application.

I feel that the inventory portion is where I really pushed the envelope, I've only worked with mongoDB and learning a new SQL language along with implementing within an application has been quite the challenge and time sink, but I'm glad I stuck with it stayed motivated and ensured that I did my best to steer to the course to completion.
